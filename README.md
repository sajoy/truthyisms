# Holzer Inspiration (WT)

A browser extension that brings Jenny Holzer inspired work to your internet browsing experience.

## Thoughts

1. The internet is a public place, but the experience is very different from being out in a public place.
1. What are the walls we can plaster with posters? 


## Plans
1. Add an element to a page (randomly selected position, time, etc) that is Holzer-esque in its appearance and statement (or actually use her work).
1. Appearance: like scrolling LED's or serious engraved plaques or fading and peeling posters or large bright projections.
    1. Decision to make: utilize all styles or stick with one. (Probably start with one.)
1. Statement: short statements about various potentially controversial topics - possibly use hers plus add some that reflect and address more internet related topics
1. Make it easy to dismiss the work - either through the menu, or on the page.
