            <h2>Jenny Holzer</h2>
            <p>Jenny Holzer is an American artist best known for her text-based work. Often her work displays thought-provoking statements and phrases in public places using a variety of mediums: paper posters, marble benches, large projections on buildings, LED marquees, and more.</p>
            <p>Read more about her and see examples of her work on <a href="http://projects.jennyholzer.com/" target="_blank">her website</a> or <a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/jenny-holzer/" target="_blank">artnet.com</a></p>

            <h2>Truisms</h2>
            <p>Her first public work, Truisms are statements Holzer collected and created then distributed around New York City on paper posters.</p>
            <p>The statements are brief, sometimes controversial, and meant to inspire people to pause and think. Some examples: "AMBIVALENCE CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE", "LACK OF CHARISMA CAN BE FATAL", "TECHNOLOGY WILL MAKE OR BREAK US".</p>

            <h2>Truthyisms</h2>
            <p>Truthyisms, the browser extension, is a virtual interpretation of Holzer's Truisms, with the internet as our city. It's an exploration of the question: how can I interrupt you when you're wandering the sidewalks of the world wide web? </p>
            <p>The answer, for now, is to decorate occasional randomly selected websites with Truisms engraved in marble plaques.</p>
            <p>Truthyisms, the open-source statements, are technology focused phrases that can be created and added by anyone. Holzer's original truisms are still relevant today, but the influence of the internet has brought us new experiences. What new truthyness is there?</p>
