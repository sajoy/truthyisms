# Holzer Inspiration (WT)

A browser extension that brings Jenny Holzer truisms and more to your internet browsing experience.

## What?
Truthyisms is a virtual interpretation of Jenny Holzer's Truisms. Truisms were brief, thought-provoking statements printed on posters and distributed around New York City. Statements such as: "AMBIVALENCE CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE", "LACK OF CHARISMA CAN BE FATAL", "TECHNOLOGY WILL MAKE OR BREAK US". This extension is an exploration of the questions: how would that look in the virtual city that is the internet? how can I interrupt you when you're wandering the sidewalks of the world wide web?

For now, it randomly adds Truism and Truism-inspired statements to the websites you visit in the form of engraved marble plaques.

## Thoughts

1. The internet is a public place, but the experience is very different from being out in a public place.
1. What are the walls we can plaster with posters? 


## Plans
1. Add an element to a page (randomly selected position, time, etc) that is Holzer-esque in its appearance and statement (or actually use her work).
1. Appearance: like scrolling LED's or serious engraved plaques or fading and peeling posters or large bright projections.
    1. Decision to make: utilize all styles or stick with one. (Probably start with one.)
    1. Marble bench
        1. as header
    1. projected letters - on images
    1. LED's down the side?
1. Statement: short statements about various potentially controversial topics - possibly use hers plus add some that reflect and address more internet related topics
1. Make it easy to dismiss the work - either through the menu, or on the page.
1. Marble bench breaks some websites:
    1. gmail, google landing page
